* we are going to merge two linked lists 
# feature tasks

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
* Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
* This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
* Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
* Should raise exception when called on empty stack
* Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
* Should raise exception when called on empty stack
* Define a method called isEmpty that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
* Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
* This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
* Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
* Should raise exception when called on empty queue
* Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
* Should raise exception when called on empty queue
* Define a method called isEmpty that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.
