* 8,4,23,42,16,15 → 4,8,23,42,16,15		|| 8 will move past 4 
* 4,8,23,42,16,15 → 4,8,23,42,16,15 	||	8 is not greater then 23 so it stays the same 
* 4,8,23,42,16,15   → 4,8,15,42,16,23	||	23 is not greater than 42 so it will go to less than 16 so it swaps with 15 
* 4,8,15,42,16,23 → 4,8,15,16,42,23	||	42 is greater than 16 so it pushes to the right of 16
* 4,8,15,16,42,23 → 4,8,15,16,23,42	||	and finally 42 is greater than 42 so it moves pushes to right of 23
